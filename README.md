# google-homepage
First Odin Project project

For this assingment I did a visual recreation of the Google Homepage(google.com). This was a visual recreation so not everything functioned correctly. I did make the top and bottom navbars work though. Overall I am pretty happy with how 
it came out. I used a lot of what I learned from Free Code Camp including flexbox, grid, and visual design. I did have to copy a little bit from Google to figure out a few things but by the end I delated most of that code and replaced
it so it evens out. I never figured out how to get the image inside the search bar but I imagine it involves <div></div>. I really wish I was better at having the language memorized. I could remeber what the css did but I often forgot 
exactly what to type. I do really appreciate how coding has so many different solutions for one problem like how you can code each element indivdually to keep it how you want it or slap some <div>s around it and you can control all of it
at once. I also learned how often I have like 99% of the code right but because I forgot a comma it doesn't work. That can be extremely annoying...
